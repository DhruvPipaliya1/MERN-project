MERN Stack Project 🌐

Built with MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js
This project is a full-stack web application created during my MERN Stack learning journey, inspired by CodeWithHarry's MERN tutorial.


🧠 About

The project demonstrates the MERN stack workflow, connecting a React frontend with a Node.js + Express backend and storing data in MongoDB.
Key concepts covered:
RESTful APIs
CRUD operations
Frontend-backend integration
State management in React
Handling asynchronous requests


🚀 Features

Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations
Responsive React frontend
API endpoints built with Express.js
Data stored in MongoDB
Simple and extendable for learning purposes


💻 Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js, Bootstrap / Tailwind CSS
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB (Atlas or local)
Libraries / Tools: Axios, Mongoose, Nodemon


⚡ Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mern-project.git
cd mern-project

Install backend dependencies:
cd backend
npm install

Install frontend dependencies:
npm install

Start the backend server:
cd ../backend
npm run dev

Start the frontend:
npm start

Open the browser at http://localhost:3000


🧩 Usage

Interact with the frontend to create, read, update, or delete data.
The frontend sends requests to the backend API, which stores/retrieves data from MongoDB.
Can be extended to include authentication, advanced state management, or additional features.
